# Advent Of Code 2023
This project contains my solutions for the 2023 Advent of Code challenge.
Every day has its own folder with the example input and the solution.
As requested by the creator, the personalised datasets are not included in this repository.

To run a solution, place your personalised input into the day folder and run the following command:
```bash
tsc
```
```bash
node dist/{{DAY_NUMBER}}/{{FILENAME}}.js
```

## Progress
